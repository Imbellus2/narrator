## Overview

The [Ink](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/) language parser and runtime implementation in Roblox Lua.

Ink is a powerful narrative scripting language. You can find more information about how to write Ink scripts [here](https://github.com/inkle/ink/blob/master/Documentation/WritingWithInk.md). There is also [Inky](https://github.com/inkle/inky) editor with useful features to test and debug Ink scripts.

Narrator allows to convert raw Ink scripts to the book (a lua table) and play it as story.

- ðŸ“– A book is a passive model on the shelf like a game level.
- âœ¨ A story is a runtime state of the book reading like a game process.

## Quick example

```lua
local narrator = require('narrator.narrator')

-- Parse a book from the Ink file.
local book = narrator.parse_file('stories.game')

-- Init a story from the book
local story = narrator.init_story(book)

-- Begin the story
story:begin()

while story:can_continue() do

  -- Get current paragraphs to output
  local paragraphs = story:continue()

  for _, paragraph in ipairs(paragraphs) do
    local text = paragraph.text

    -- You can handle tags as you like, but we attach them to text here.
    if paragraph.tags then
      text = text .. ' #' .. table.concat(paragraph.tags, ' #')
    end

    -- Output text to the player
    print(text)
  end

  -- If there is no choice it seems like the game is over
  if not story:can_choose() then break end

  -- Get available choices and output them to the player
  local choices = story:get_choices()
  for i, choice in ipairs(choices) do
    print(i .. ') ' .. choice.text)
  end

  -- Read the choice from the player input
  local answer = tonumber(io.read())

  -- Send answer to the story to generate new paragraphs
  story:choose(answer)
end
```

## Installation

### Common case (LÃ¶ve, pure Lua, etc.)

Download the latest [release archive](https://github.com/astrochili/narrator/releases) and require the `narrator` module.

```lua
local narrator = require('narrator.narrator')
```

Narrator requires [lpeg](http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg/) as dependency to parse Ink content. You can install it with [luarocks](https://luarocks.org/). But we currently do not support the Lpeg library at Roblox, until we do .ink parsing will have to happen offline, stored as a .lua and uploaded as a 'dataset'.

### Parsing .ink files Offline

Follow [this guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kvr5_7Y5QYk1ea53jOyKLnRXfoWBX45ZGG1lvElq9Og/edit?pli=1#heading=h.zi8clh5jyu67) for Narrator installation and offline parsing.

### Running Narrator in Roblox experience

With Narrator.choice, a dynamic string is executed based on the path of the story tree traversal using `loadstring()`. This is by default disabled in production experiences, so enable it as a flag in project.json:

```json
"ServerScriptService": {
    "$className": "ServerScriptService",
    "Scripts": {
        "$path": "src/Server/Scripts"
    },
    "$properties": {
        "LoadStringEnabled": true
    }
},
```


## Documentation

### narrator.parse_file(path, params)

Parses the Ink file at path with all the inclusions and returns a book instance. Path notations `'stories/game.ink'`, `'stories/game'` and `'stories.game'` are valid.

You can save a parsed book to the lua file with the same path by passing `{ save = true }` as `params` table. By default, the `params` table is `{ save = false }`.

```lua
-- Parse a Ink file at path 'stories/game.ink'
local book = narrator.parse_file('stories.game')

-- Parse a Ink file at path 'stories/game.ink'
-- and save the book at path 'stories/game.lua'
local book = narrator.parse_file('stories.game', { save = true })
```
Reading and saving files required `io` so if you can't work with files by this way use `narrator.parse_content()`.

### narrator.parse_content(content, inclusions)

Parses the string with Ink content and returns a book instance. The `inclusions` param is optional and can be used to pass an array of strings with Ink content of inclusions.

```lua
local content = 'Content of a root Ink file'
local inclusions = {
  'Content of an included Ink file',
  'Content of another included Ink file'
}

-- Parse a string with Ink content
local book = narrator.parse_content(content)

-- Parse a string with Ink content and inclusions
local book = narrator.parse_content(content, inclusions)
```

Content parsing is useful when you should manage files by your engine environment and don't want to use `io` module. For example, in Defold, you may want to load ink files as custom resources with [sys.load_resource()](https://defold.com/ref/sys/#sys.load_resource:filename).

### Narrator.init_story(book)

Inits a story instance from the book. This is aclual to use in production. For example, just load a book with `require()` and pass it to this function.

```lua
-- Require a parsed and saved before book
local Narrator = require(ReplicatedStorage.Packages.Narrator)
-- Load runtime story of book
local story = Narrator.init_story(book)
```

### Narrator.continue(story)

Continue a story along the book state

```lua
local Narrator = require(ReplicatedStorage.Packages.Narrator)
local output = Narrator.continue(story)

local story = output.story
local content = output.content

local choices = content.choices
local paragraphs = content.paragraphs
```

### Narrator.choose(story, index)

Make a choice to continue the story. Pass the `index` of the choice that you was received with `get_choices()` before. Will do nothing if `can_continue()` returns `false`.

```lua
local Narrator = require(ReplicatedStorage.Packages.Narrator)
story = Narrator.choose(story, index)
```

## Contribution

### Development

There are some useful extensions and configs for [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) that I use in development of Narrator.

- [Local Lua Debugger](https://github.com/tomblind/local-lua-debugger-vscode) by [tomblind](https://github.com/tomblind/).
- [Lua Language Server](https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server) by [sunmeko](https://github.com/sumneko).
- A task named `Busted` runs tests with `tests/run.lua`.
- A lunch configuration named `Busted` runs the debugger with `tests/run.lua`.
- A lunch configuration named `Debug` runs the debugger with `debug.lua`.
